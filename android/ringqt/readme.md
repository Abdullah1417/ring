Ring For Mobile App Development (Android, iOS and Windows Phone) using Qt
=========================================================================

(1) Download Requirements
	http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/androidgs.html
	* The Android SDK Tools
		https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
	* The Android NDK 
		https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html
	* Apache Ant v1.8 or later 
		http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
	* Java SE Development Kit (JDK) v6 or later
		http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

(2) Update the Android SDK to get the API and tools packages required for development

(3) Install Qt for Android
		https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.5/5.5.1/

(4) Run Qt Creator, Select Tools > Options > Android to add the 
    Android NDK and SDK paths. 
		http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-developing-android.html

(5) Using Qt Creator Open the project 
	Folder : project
	Project file : project.pro

(6) Using Qt Creator, You will find the compiled Ring application in resources\ringapp.ringo

	This file (Ring Object File) is generated by the Ring compiler using

	ring ringapp.ring -go -norun

(7) To run your application instead of the default application

	7.1 : Using Qt Creator, Add your application images to resources

		Or You can use any text editor (Notepad) and modify : project.qrc

	7.2 : To find images from your Ring application, You need to use the file name in resources

	Example 

		if isandroid()
    			mypic = new QPixmap(":/resources/cardsimage")
		else
    			mypic = new QPixmap("cards.jpg")
		ok

	7.3 : In your Ring application folder (Using the command prompt)

		ring myapp.ring -go -norun

	7.4 : Add your file to the project project/myapp.ringo 

	7.5 : Update main.cpp and project.qrc and replace ringapp.ringo with myapp.ringo

	7.6 : Build and Run your Application using Qt Creator

Comments

(1) The main project file is main.cpp 
	This file load Ring Compiler/Virtual Machine and RingQt 
	Then copy files during the runtime from the resources to temp. folder 
	Then run the ringapp.ringo file

(2) The next functions are missing from this Ring edition
	* Database (ODBC, SQLite & MySQL)
	* Security and Internet functions (LibCurl & OpenSSL)
	* RingAllegro (Allegro Library)
	* RingLibSDL (LibSDL Library)

	Just use Qt Classes through RingQt
	For database access use the QSqlDatabase Class

	Note: All of the missing libraries ((LibCurl, OpenSSL & Allegro) can be compiled for Android.
	      But they are not included in this Qt project.
